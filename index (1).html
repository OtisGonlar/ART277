 <p>We’ve heard it all since the pandemic started —lemon juice can kill the coronavirus, masks 
don’t work, if you already had <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1">COVID-19</a> you can’t get it again or that the vaccines approved for 
emergency use will change your DNA or put a tracking device in your body. </p><br>

<p>It’s almost like we need a strong doseof something to knock out all of the misinformation. But 
despite all the myths and urban legends, about half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.</p><br>

<p>Wonderful news, right? Wonderful news, right?</p>

<p>Well, not to some. Vaccinated people are up against a 
going to shed vaccine components and alter the DNA of 
unvaccinated people. And despite the extra layer of 
new set of myths —they’re literally magnetic or they’re 
protection, they still have to grapple with the same 
pandemic realities as everyone else.</p><br>
<p>So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread 
COVID19 to others? Infectious disease specialist <a href="https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-lyssette-cardona-ybpg8">Lyssette Cardona</a>,MD, answers those 
questions and covers why vaccination is still one of our best weapons in the fight against COVID
19.</p><br>
<p>isn’t the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that 
you could become infected.</p><br>
